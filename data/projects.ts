    summary: 'Complete pre-purchase assessment and renovation strategy for a dilapidated 3-bedroom Victorian terrace.',
    challenge: 'The client was looking to purchase a Victorian terrace that hadn\'t been touched in 40 years. They needed to know if their budget of £80k would cover the necessary structural work, new roof, and full internal modernisation.',
    solution: 'We conducted a full structural survey and provided a detailed schedule of works. We identified that the roof needed complete replacement rather than just repairs, which wasn\'t in their initial budget. We created a phased plan to prioritize the weathertight shell first.',
    result: 'The client used our report to negotiate £15k off the asking price. They completed the renovation within budget by following our phased approach, focusing on structural integrity before high-end finishes.',

    summary: 'Feasibility study for a double-storey extension and open-plan reconfiguration.',
    challenge: 'Clients wanted to buy a tired bungalow with the intention of turning it into a 4-bedroom family home. They needed to know if planning permission was likely and if the existing foundations could support a second story.',
    solution: 'We arranged for test holes to check foundations and consulted with a local planning officer. We produced concept sketches showing two potential layouts: one with a dormer conversion and one with a full extension.',
    result: 'The foundation checks revealed the need for underpinning, which would have blown the budget. The clients decided NOT to purchase, saving themselves from a money pit. They later found a more suitable property with our help.',

    summary: 'Cost estimation and compliance check for converting a warehouse space into modern offices.',
    challenge: 'A business owner wanted to buy an empty warehouse unit. The concern was fire safety compliance and the cost of installing modern HVAC systems.',
    solution: 'We provided a detailed compliance report and obtained quotes from trusted HVAC specialists. We also highlighted potential issues with acoustic insulation between floors.',
    result: 'Armed with accurate costs for the mechanical and electrical fit-out, the client secured the property and proceeded with a clear 12-week build programme.',
