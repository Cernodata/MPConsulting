      <p>Buying a fixer-upper is a dream for many. The idea of taking a tired property and transforming it into your dream home—while potentially making a profit—is incredibly appealing. However, without the right eye, that dream can quickly turn into a nightmare.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Structural Cracks</h3>
      <p>Not all cracks are created equal. Hairline cracks in plaster are common, but large stepped cracks in brickwork or diagonal cracks around windows can indicate subsidence or lintel failure. These are expensive fixes.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Damp and Mould</h3>
      <p>The smell is usually the first giveaway. Look for tide marks on walls, peeling wallpaper, or black mould in corners. Is it just condensation, or is it rising damp? The difference in repair costs is massive.</p>
      
      <h3>3. The Roof</h3>
      <p>Stand across the street and look at the roof lines. Are they straight? Are there missing tiles? A sagging roof could mean the internal timbers are rotting or undersized. A full re-roof on a standard semi-detached house can easily cost £6,000-£10,000+.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Electrics and Plumbing</h3>
      <p>Look at the fuse box (consumer unit). If it has old rewirable fuses, the house likely needs a full rewire (budget £4k-£6k). Similarly, look for lead pipes or old galvanized steel tanks.</p>
      
      <h3>5. Japanese Knotweed</h3>
      <p>Check the garden. This invasive plant can make a property unmortgageable. It's difficult and expensive to eradicate.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>Always get a professional assessment before you commit. A few hundred pounds spent on advice now could save you tens of thousands later.</p>

    title: 'How Much Does an Extension Really Cost in 2024?',
    excerpt: 'Material prices have fluctuated wildly. Here is a realistic guide to what you should expect to pay for a single-storey extension per square metre.',

      <p>One of the most common questions we get is: "How much will an extension cost?" The answer is always: "It depends." But that's not helpful when you're trying to budget.</p>
      
      <h3>The "Per Square Metre" Rule</h3>
      <p>As a very rough guide for 2024 in the North West:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Shell:</strong> £1,800 - £2,200 per m²</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Finish:</strong> £2,200 - £2,800 per m²</li>
        <li><strong>High Spec:</strong> £3,000+ per m²</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>So, a standard 4m x 5m (20m²) extension would likely start at around £44,000 for the build alone.</p>
      
      <h3>Don't Forget the "Extras"</h3>
      <p>The build cost is just part of the picture. You must also factor in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>VAT (20%):</strong> This is huge. On a £50k build, that's another £10k.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional Fees:</strong> Architects, structural engineers, building control (allow 10-15%).</li>
        <li><strong>Finishes:</strong> Kitchens, flooring, and decorating are often extra to the builder's quote.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>At Build Clarity, we provide detailed cost breakdowns so you can see exactly where your money is going before you start digging foundations.</p>

    excerpt: 'You might be able to build more than you think without full planning permission. We explain the rules of Permitted Development.',

      <p>Did you know you can often extend the rear of your house by up to 6 metres (or 8 metres for detached homes) without full planning permission? This is thanks to Permitted Development (PD) rights.</p>
      
      <h3>What is Permitted Development?</h3>
      <p>PD rights are a grant of planning permission by the government. They allow for certain types of work without the need to apply for planning permission. However, specific limits and conditions apply.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Limitations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Height:</strong> Single-storey extensions must not exceed 4m in height.</li>
        <li><strong>Materials:</strong> Must be similar in appearance to the existing house.</li>
        <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> Extensions (plus other buildings) cannot cover more than 50% of the land around the original house.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Lawful Development Certificate</h3>
      <p>Even if you don't need planning permission, we highly recommend getting a Lawful Development Certificate. This proves your build was legal—vital when you eventually come to sell the property.</p>
